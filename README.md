# Hi, I'm Harshavardhan Nandigama
a self-motivated DevOps and Cloud enthusiast with hands-on experience in building secure, scalable infrastructure using AWS and modern DevOps tools.

With a B.Tech in Electrical & Electronics Engineering and a strong curiosity for automation and cloud technologies, I transitioned into DevOps through self-learning and real-time projects. I’m passionate about Infrastructure as Code (IaC), CI/CD automation, and DevSecOps best practices.

### Secure 3-Tier E-Commerce Microservices Architecture on AWS

Built and deployed a production-grade **e-commerce application** using a **3-tier microservices architecture** with full network isolation and security:
- **Frontend** served via ALB + Route 53 in a public subnet
- **Microservices (User, Cart, Shipping, Catalogue, Payment)** hosted in private subnets
- **Databases (MongoDB, Redis, MySQL, RabbitMQ)** securely placed in a database subnet
- Used **Security Groups, NACLs, KMS encryption**, and **VPN access** to enforce secure communication
- Provisioned infrastructure with **Terraform**, automated deployments with **Jenkins**, and implemented GitOps using **Argo CD & Helm**
  
📌 This project provided me with end-to-end exposure to designing, provisioning, securing, and operating cloud-native applications on AWS, preparing me for real-world DevOps roles.
